# PM-Vue


This is the first version of a vuejs adaptation of a personal project of mine, Project Mountain.<br>
This is currently WIP since i still need to develop the backend for the backpack feature in the non Vuejs version.<br> This vuejs version is made as a way to experiment with the vuejs frontend capability.<br>
The library used as a support of this project are <b>OpenLayers</b> to plot on an OpenstreetMap all the trekking course, <b>Chartjs</b> to plot the elevation profile based on the course that the user chooses to see.
